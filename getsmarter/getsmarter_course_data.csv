What are common types of cyberattacks?
Data breaches and cyberattacks come in many forms, and there are many common types of attacks that you should be aware of. One common type of cyberattack is phishing, a technique used to obtain digital information such as passwords or credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy entity by using electronic communication. Cybercriminals often use phishing emails as the initial entry point into a network to steal data or install malware. Malware is another common type of cyberattack and refers to software designed to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to a computer. A cybersecurity course is a great way to gain an understanding of cyberattacks and improve cybersecurity skills.
Protect networks and computer systems
It's important that business leaders and cybersecurity professionals, such as a cybersecurity engineer and security architect, protect networks and computer systems from unauthorized access and cyber threats. Data breaches and cyberattacks can have a devastating effect on individuals, businesses, and governments, making data integrity a key  issue for organizations.
Ensure data integrity
Data integrity is the assurance that data has not been changed or corrupted in any way, accidental or intentional. This cybersecurity course can equip you with cybersecurity awareness, understanding, and skills to develop and lead your organization's cybersecurity plan.

Importance of a supply chain management strategy
Every business is different, so your supply chain management strategy will be unique to your organisation. To develop an effective, sustainable supply chain management strategy, you'll need to consider your organisation's business model, industry, sector, suppliers, partners, and customers. A supply chain management strategy spells out an organisation's goals, objectives, and plans to achieve them. The strategy defines what the company wants to do and how it plans to do it. It also sets the direction for the entire organisation, from top to bottom. A well-defined supply chain management strategy can help an organisation improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, reduce costs, and increase revenue.2

While algorithmic trading has been around for a long time, the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has substantially accelerated its course of development. This allows trading algorithms to find market efficiencies and better recognise profitable patterns of their own accord, making trades at a very high frequency. The performance of these algorithms, therefore, often exceeds those of professional traders and financial advisors.
The Oxford Algorithmic Trading Programme from Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, equips you with a comprehensive understanding of the rules that drive successful algorithmic trading strategies and hedge funds, as well as a grounded introduction to financial theory and behavioural finance. Over the course of six weeks, you’ll learn four principles established by Programme Director Nir Vulkan, to guide you through the process of evaluating an algorithmic trading model. You’ll also discover what biases are present in the market and how these behavioural traits create exploitable patterns. On completion, you’ll have the ability to assess whether a trading model or fund is worth investing in.
Is this programme for you?This programme is aimed at working professionals in the trading and investment space or those not currently familiar with the algorithmic trading platform. It will be of value to anyone interested in hearing from industry leaders and top academics on the key issues facing algorithmic systematic traders. The programme will also interest professionals looking to learn about the predicted impact of AI and automation on the course of financial trading’s future. Private and part-time traders who wish to improve their trading abilities and experiment with algorithmic trading models will also benefit from the programme.

As a result, diet has the potential to increase gut microbial diversity and regulate immune responses.Science Direct (Aug, 2021).Duration: 2 weeks

Thriving research into the link between the gut and health gives new meaning to the adage ‘you are what you eat’. Beginning at birth, a community of 10-100 trillion microbes populates the human intestinal tract. Just as the body undergoes physiological changes, this invisible ecosystem — the gut microbiome — transforms and is shaped by what you eat and where you live. Now, studies show that microbes aren’t just good for the gut: they can impact the immune system too.1 Understanding the human microbiome in all its complexity has become a scientific and medical priority that could lead to industry-changing interventions and new potential for promoting overall wellness.

Discover the science behind human microbiota in the Gut Health and the Microbiome online micro course from the Stanford Center for Health Education (SCHE), part of Stanford Medicine. Over two short weeks, you’ll learn exactly what the microbiome is, how it’s integrated into human physiology, and the ways it can improve health and treat disease beyond just the gut. Guided by Stanford Medicine experts, you’ll explore how the microbiome is targeted to treat a variety of disease states, and how it continues to guide precision health therapies of the future.

Gallup (Jul, 2021).
Duration: 6 weeks (excluding orientation)The Oxford Organisational Effectiveness Programme is a specialised business strategy programme that highlights the impact of aligning purpose, strategy, and capability. The programme takes a fresh approach to an established concept by proposing strategies devised from insights in a new field of research termed ‘strategic alignment’.
Strategic alignment encapsulates the intersection of leadership and strategy to ultimately improve the effectiveness, operations, and performance of an enterprise and its project management. It also ensures organisational capability and strengthens teams by driving individuals within the enterprise to work together toward a common goal. In a highly competitive, complex, and shifting marketplace, this alignment can determine organisational success or failure.
Based on active research at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, the programme investigates each link of the enterprise value chain that forms the core foundation of every organisation. Over the course of six weeks, it uses evidence-based insights, strategic frameworks, project case studies, and real-world applications to help you understand this new concept. As you position yourself to transform and future-proof your enterprise, you'll gain the practical skills to produce and apply a fit-for-purpose business strategy for your organisation’s unique context.
Is this programme for you?This programme takes a unique view on organisational effectiveness, aligning purpose, strategy, and capability. It aims to equip you with the intellectual toolkit to facilitate strategic alignment in any enterprise, be it in the private, public, government, or not-for-profit sector. While the practical application of your learnings, as well as stakeholder buy-in, is dependent on your level of influence, the principles taught are industry-agnostic. Guided by Oxford Saïd faculty,  heads of department, middle management, HR professionals as well as those in the field of project management, will learn how to strengthen their teams and facilitate strategic alignment between departments and within projects. Executives, directors, and business leaders tasked with operational transformation will benefit from the strategic approach to improving performance, creating future-facing objectives, and enhancing leadership skills. Consultants will explore the latest research and improve their ability to advise on clients’ organisational effectiveness.


This Oxford Organisational Effectiveness Programme is certified by the United Kingdom CPD Certification Service, and may be applicable to individuals who are members of, or are associated with, UK-based professional bodies. The programme has an estimated 60 hours of learning.
Note: should you wish to claim CPD activity, the onus is on you. Oxford Saïd and GetSmarter accept no responsibility, and cannot be held responsible, for the claiming or validation of hours or points.

In addition, it’s critical to have the right leadership in place to support change in your organization.
What key strategies are needed to achieve successful change management in an organization?To effectively manage an organizational strategy for change, it’s important to have a clear roadmap defining concrete steps that encompasses all aspects of the change process.
What key performance indicators should be included in a strategic change management plan?There are several key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be used to measure the success of change management initiatives.

In a simple and stable environment, this approach may be effective, but today’s business world is far from simple or stable. As the corporate landscape becomes more changeable and complex — with multicultural teams, hybrid working, competitive markets, faster product cycles, digitalization and AI — there is an urgent need for organizations and their leaders to become more agile and flexible in how they respond. They should pay attention to the context in which they operate, be ready to deploy a range of leadership approaches, and adapt as their business landscape changes.Based on years of research by the Program Directors, the Organizational Leadership: Driving Culture and Performance online program from the Institute for Management Development (IMD) is designed to enhance your impact as a leader.

Duration: 7 weeks (excluding orientation)
As the business environment becomes increasingly uncertain, it’s apparent that traditional approaches to strategy are no longer sufficient to navigate such rapid change. Leaders now need to ask, “How should strategy evolve to better prepare us for the future?” The Oxford Executive Strategy Programme seeks to answer this question.
Informed by the distinct research strengths of Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, the programme unpacks how strategy is changing and how breadth within strategic thinking, in addition to thinking long-term, is imperative to leading strategy. You’ll learn about strategy from Oxford’s unique perspective, based on a core framework of the four Ps: purposes, players, partnerships, and processes. With this new approach to organisational strategy that considers rapidly changing environments, stakeholders, and digital transformation, you’ll become prepared to lead strategy in disruptive environments.
The content of this programme also forms part of the six-month online Oxford Strategic Management Executive Programme, designed to help you advance as a business executive.
Is this programme for you?This online programme is relevant to business leaders and senior executives who are responsible for making strategic decisions, driving digital innovation, and managing strategy within disruptive environments. Those looking to optimise their current performance for a competitive and digital business landscape will be able to immediately apply the Oxford approach to strategy within their own context. Professionals working towards a future leadership role or career will gain practical guidance on improving strategies within their teams. Over the course of seven weeks online, the programme balances theory with practical global case studies from various industries, ensuring those in traditional corporate spaces, finance, business development, healthcare, and IT find relevance within their own organisational context.

For years, power in the workplace has been associated with traits such as persuasion, charisma, and outward displays of authority and strength. This has caused some women leaders to disidentify with power as a concept, even undermining their own progression. However, as traditional productivity metrics become unsustainable in the face of growing burnout and disengagement, a new leadership approach focusing on well-being, purpose, and belonging is needed. Communication, empathy, authenticity, and honesty hold more value than ever before.    The Women’s Leadership Program: Leading With Power and Influence from the Yale School of Management Executive Education equips you to become the positively energizing leader to drive change. Over the course of six weeks online, you’ll discover a broader definition of power as a buildable skill set that incorporates both strong and empathic traits and can shift depending on context. You’ll explore existing power structures and dynamics in organizations, and uncover how a growth mindset can help you influence others and effect positive change in your sphere of influence. Guided by experts, you’ll also discover key strategies that can help you use everyday junctures for power and change, and enhance your ability to cultivate positive relational energy to promote organizational success.

Shifting attitudes, new technologies, and a growing investment landscape are creating the ideal habitat for start-ups, yet two out of three entrepreneurial endeavours don’t succeed.1 Two major reasons for failure are cash depletion and the inability to secure financing or investor interest. Capital investment is available – as can be gleaned from the record $8 billion invested in UK technology sector start-ups – but it’s up to entrepreneurs to ensure that they have the skills to negotiate and pitch their ideas in order to secure funding from the right investors at the right time.2 Similarly, investors who are looking to capitalise on the budding start-up market require the insight to effectively evaluate business opportunities in order to make sound financing decisions.
The Entrepreneurial Finance online certificate course from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is designed to address both sides of the investment paradigm. Over six weeks online, you’ll learn to critically evaluate business opportunities and explore how to match financing needs with the most appropriate investor type. You’ll be given top tips from industry experts on how to negotiate with investors and sell your business concept. By the end of this functional six-week course, you’ll learn how to develop an effective pitch deck to prepare for real-life pitch scenarios.

Increased movement and mobility of people has accelerated cultural diversity in the workforce. Organisations and leaders are positioned to ensure that employees – no matter their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion – are treated fairly. But in reality, ideas, intent, and action are often disconnected.
Inclusion in today’s workplace is an important measure that directly impacts not only the balance sheet, but talent retention. If, and when, employees don’t feel heard, accepted, or truly valued, they’re far less likely to remain at a company. In one study, employees who identified as ‘different’ were shown to experience greater burnout and felt a lesser sense of belonging.1 With trends like the great resignation in full swing, employers are in crisis mode trying to resolve the retention issues upending the job market.2 But increased pay and elevated role titles aren’t enough, inclusion is the essential third factor, and it starts with leaders who build well-being and openness into their organisation’s DNA.
This eight-week course from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) provides you with insights from behavioural science that will enable you to create a more resilient and collaborative organisation. Leveraging an inclusive approach to leadership, you’ll learn how to implement practical and effective solutions to problems caused by entrenched bias, heuristics, and groupthink. With insights from Dr Grace Lordan, founder of The Inclusion Initiative (TII) at LSE, you’ll develop keen interpersonal and relational skills to improve search and hiring processes, mitigate poor conduct, and ensure career opportunities across the board.

Why have there been more cases and deaths in some countries compared to others? How much of this difference is due to the country’s health system? This six-week Analysing Health Systems: Lessons From COVID-19 online certificate course from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) has been designed by faculty from the Department of Health Policy at LSE. Their aim is to influence and improve how health policy and systems are designed, implemented, and evaluated through multidisciplinary research and teaching. These experts have made substantive contributions to health planning and delivery on the global stage.The course explores the many ways the pandemic has challenged the structure of existing health systems – these effects range from financial losses and disparities in healthcare quality and coverage to failings in institutional and health system governance. Through the lens of COVID-19, you’ll develop the tools and expertise to critically evaluate the performance of health systems, and examine the reasons why some were better prepared than, and outperformed, others. On this course, you’ll gain a technical understanding of health system performance and response, learn to identify and understand the systematic issues experienced around the world, and determine the actions required to improve these structures.Is this course for you?This course is designed to provide medical and public sector professionals with the tools to measure and monitor healthcare service delivery, analyse past response frameworks, and better prepare for future health crises.
